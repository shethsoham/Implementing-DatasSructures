Stack

The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last in first Out (LIFO)

The last elements inserted into the stack is first element to be removed

example : A stack of plates.The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack.

Stack is a abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

The stack data structure supports two main operations 

1.Push, which add an elements to the collection 
2.Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection.
