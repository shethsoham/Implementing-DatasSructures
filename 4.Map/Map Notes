Map

A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. 
Bot keys and values can be of any data type

To retrieve a value, you use the corresponding key

Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.

Difference between maps and objects

Objects vs Map

Objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered

Keys in object can only be string or symbols type,
whereas in maps they can be of any type.

An object has a prototype and may contain few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you are not careful.
A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default.

Objects are not iterables where as maps are iterables

The number of items in an object must be determined manually where as it is readily available with the size property in maps.

Apart from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data.

//To create a new map we use Map constructor.

const map_1 = new Map([['a',1],['b',2]])
// To add the new values we use set method
// this set is the method and not data structure which we previusoly covered
map_1.set('c',3)

// to check if key exist in map we use .has method

console.log(map_1.has('c'))
//The constructor optionally accepts array as it's argument 

// to delete we use delete keyword
map_1.delete('a')

// to check the size we use size method
console.log(map_1.size)

// to clear key value pair of map we use clear method

map_1.clear()

for(const [key,value] of map_1){
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`)
}
